/* Day1 Question ->

The program must accept two string values S1 and S2 and an integer K as the input. The programmust print yes if the number of uncommon alphabets in both the string values are equal to K. Else
the program must print no as the output.

Note: The value of K is always less than or equal to the sum of the lengths of S1 and S2.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Length of S1, S2 <= 1000

Input Format:
The first line contains S1, S2 and K separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first line contains yes or no.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
AbcdefGh abceff 6

Output:
yes

Explanation:
Here K = 6.

The uncommon alphabets in both the string values (AbcdefGh abceff) are A, d, G, h, a and f.Here the number of uncommon alphabets is 6, which is equal to K. So yes is printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
skill rack 5

Output:
no

Explanation:
Here K = 5.

The uncommon alphabets in both the string values (skill rack) are s, i, I, I, r, a and c.Here the number of uncommon alphabets is 7, which is not equal to K. So no is printed as the output.
